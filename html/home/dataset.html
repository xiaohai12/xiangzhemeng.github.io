                This dataset contains product reviews and metadata from Amazon, including 142.8 million reviews spanning from May 1996 to July 2014.
            </p>
            <p class="offset-1" style="font-size: 16px;">
                This dataset includes reviews (ratings, text, helpfulness votes), product metadata (descriptions, category information, price, brand, and image features), and links (also viewed/also bought graphs).
            </p>
            <p class="offset-1" style="font-size: 16px;">
                In the dataset of metadata, format is one-product-per-line in json.

            <p class="offset-1" style="font-size: 16px;">
                This project will mostly use two subsets of the Amazon reviews dataset: Kindle store metadata and review datasets. We are going to use reviews dataset for rating and review analysis and product metadata dataset for kindle book categorization and classification.            </p>
            <p class="offset-1" style="font-size: 16px;">
                The dataset of reviews provides us with the text of review, rating information, and importantly, the time of review, which is good for chronological analysis. The dataset of metadata provides us with various ways for product classification in terms of category. The data of sales rank might also be helpful to determine the popularity and sales of one book.            </p>
